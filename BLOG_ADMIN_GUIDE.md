## Technical Details

### Data Management

Currently, the system uses in-memory storage for demonstration purposes. All changes will persist during your session but will reset when the application restarts.

### Blog Post Structure

Each blog post contains the following fields:
```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier (auto-generated from title)
  title: string;        // Post title
  excerpt: string;      // Brief description
  content: string;      // Full HTML content
  author: string;       // Author name
  authorImage: string;  // Author photo URL
  publishDate: string;  // Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  readTime: string;     // Estimated reading time
  category: string;     // Post category
  tags: string[];       // Array of tags
  featuredImage: string;// Featured image URL
  featured: boolean;    // Whether post is featured
}
```

### HTML Content Guidelines

When writing content, you can use the following HTML tags:
- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>` for headings
- `<strong>`, `<em>` for emphasis
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for lists
- `<a>` for links
- `<img>` for images
- `<blockquote>` for quotes

Example content structure:
```html
<p class="mb-6">Your opening paragraph here...</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-playfair font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Section Heading</h2>

<p class="mb-6">Section content here...</p>

<p class="italic text-lg mt-8">With love,<br>Author Name</p>
```

## Integration with Your Website

The blog posts you create in the admin interface will automatically appear on:
- **Blog List Page** (`/blog`): Shows all published posts
- **Individual Blog Pages** (`/blog/post-id`): Shows full post content
- **Featured Posts Section**: Posts marked as "featured" appear prominently

## Production Considerations

### File Upload & Storage

Currently, the image upload feature uses placeholder URLs for demonstration. For production use, you'll need to:

1. Set up a file storage service (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. Create an upload endpoint in your backend
3. Update the `ImageUpload` component to use your upload service

### Data Persistence

To make blog posts persist permanently, you'll need to:

1. **Backend API**: Create API endpoints for CRUD operations
2. **Database**: Set up a database to store blog posts
3. **Update Functions**: Modify the blog data functions to make API calls

Example backend integration:
```typescript
// Update the blog data functions in client/data/blog.ts
export const addBlogPost = async (newPost: BlogPost): Promise<void> => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/blog', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(newPost)
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to create post');
};
```

### Security Considerations

For production deployment:
- Add authentication to protect the admin routes
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Add CSRF protection
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Validate image uploads and file types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Images not displaying**: 
- Check that image URLs are valid and accessible
- Ensure images are hosted on a reliable service
- Verify CORS settings for external images

**Content not formatting properly**:
- Check HTML syntax in content field
- Ensure CSS classes are available
- Review browser developer tools for errors

**Changes not saving**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Ensure network connectivity

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser developer console for error messages
2. Verify all required fields are completed
3. Try refreshing the page and retrying
4. Check network tab for failed requests

## Next Steps

To fully deploy this system:
1. Set up a backend API for data persistence
2. Configure file upload service for images
3. Add user authentication for admin access
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Add automated backups for blog data

The admin interface is now ready to use and will provide a professional blog management experience!
